# ForkLBomb
ForkLBomb is a Fork Bomb for Linux, a simple program that executes a denial of service (DoS) to crash this operating system. It is one of the simplest programs, a single bash file that is downloaded and executed on the victim's computer. The program calls a function (which is itself) and loops, causing Linux to crash.
